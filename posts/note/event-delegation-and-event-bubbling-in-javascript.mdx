## What is event delegation?
Event delegation is a JavaScript technique where you attach **one event listener on a parent element** instead of adding listeners to every child. The event bubbles up to the parent, and you check which child triggered it.

```javascript
<ul id="menu">
  <li>Home</li>
  <li>About</li>
  <li>Contact</li>
</ul>

<script>
  const menu = document.getElementById("menu");

  // Event delegation: one listener on the parent
  menu.addEventListener("click", (event) => {
    if (event.target.tagName === "LI") {
      console.log("You clicked:", event.target.textContent);
    }
  });
</script>
```

> **Event delegation** is a **technique** that uses bubbling so you can attach **one listener on the parent** to handle many children.
## What is event bubbling?
Event bubbling is when an event triggered on a child element **bubbles up** and also triggers listeners on its parent elements, all the way to the `document` .

```javascript
<div id="parent">
  <button id="child">Click Me</button>
</div>

<script>
  document.getElementById("child").addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Button clicked (child)");
  });

  document.getElementById("parent").addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Parent div also triggered (bubbling)");
  });

  document.body.addEventListener("click", () => {
    console.log("Body also triggered (bubbling)");
  });
</script>
```

> **Event bubbling** is the **mechanism** where an event on a child **bubbles up** to its parents.
