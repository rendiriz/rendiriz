### JavaScript

- JavaScript is the main programming language of the web that makes pages interactive.
- JavaScript runs in the browser and also on the server (with Node.js). It’s dynamic and event-driven, meaning it reacts to user actions like clicks, typing, or scrolling.
- If HTML is like the structure of a building, CSS is the paint and decoration, then JavaScript is the electricity that makes lights turn on or buttons actually work.

### TypeScript

- TypeScript is an enhanced version of JavaScript that adds “data types” to make code safer and easier to maintain.
- TypeScript was created by Microsoft, and it compiles back to plain JavaScript so it can run anywhere. The main benefit is catching errors early, before the code even runs.
- If JavaScript is like writing free-form notes, TypeScript is like writing with strict rules—clearly marking what’s a number, text, or date—so things stay organized and mistakes are reduced.
