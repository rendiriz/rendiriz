You should be in the branch you are currently modifying (not `master`) and first merge `master` into this branch: under source control, click the three dots and select in the menu `Branch` -> `Merge Branch` (see screenshot) and select `Master`. It will say you now have conflicts that you need to resolve manually, and then you should be clear to go.
