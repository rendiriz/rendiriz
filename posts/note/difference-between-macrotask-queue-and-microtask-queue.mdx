title: Difference between macrotask queue and microtask queue

JavaScript has two queues:
#### Macrotask queue / Task queue
*   Big tasks like `setTimeout`, events.
*   Includes callbacks from `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, `setImmediate` (Node), I/O, DOM events.
*   The event loop processes **one macrotask**, then checks microtasks.
#### Microtask queue
*   Smaller, high-priority tasks like promises.
*   Includes callbacks from `Promise.then/catch/finally`, `queueMicrotask`, `MutationObserver`.
*   The event loop **drains all microtasks** before handling the next macrotask.

> **Priority**: microtasks are higher priority, so they run before the next task.
