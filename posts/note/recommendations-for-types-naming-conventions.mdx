### Schemas:

- `LoginSchema` - When it's a general schema for login-related data
- `LoginFormSchema` - When it's specifically for form validation (this is better for your case since it's form-specific)
- `CreateLoginSchema` / `UpdateLoginSchema` - If you have different schemas for different operations

### DTOs (Data Transfer Objects):

- `LoginPayload` - More descriptive than `LoginDto`, clearly indicates it's data being sent
- `LoginRequest` - Alternative that clearly shows it's for API requests
- `LoginFormData` - When specifically for form data
- Avoid generic `LoginDto` as it's less descriptive of the purpose

### Responses:

- `LoginResponse` - Clear and explicit, good for API responses
- `LoginResult` - Alternative that works well
- Avoid just `Login` as it's too generic and unclear
- `LoginResponseData` - When you need to be very explicit

```typescript
// schemas/auth.ts
export const LoginFormSchema = z.object({
  email: z.string().min(1).email(),
  password: z.string().min(1),
});

// types/auth.ts
export type LoginPayload = z.infer<typeof LoginFormSchema>;

export interface LoginResponse {
  token: string;
  user: {
    id: string;
    email: string;
  };
}

// components/login-form.tsx
export const LoginForm = () => {
  const handleSubmit = async (data: LoginPayload) => {
    // ...
  };
};
```
